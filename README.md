## Porklike

This is a javascript port of the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) game created in [Lazy Devs YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLea8cjCua_P3LL7J1Q9b6PJua0A-96uUS).
I tried to stay as close to the original code as possible, though some parts had to be adjusted due to the platform differences.

Thanks Krystian for the awesome tutorial!
